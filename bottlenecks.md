### 3. GraphQL Async Session Manager Bug  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-09-05  
**Category**: Backend code error  

**Problem**: 
- Authentication succeeding in Supabase but failing in backend
- Error in logs: `Error during sign in: __aenter__`
- Users unable to complete sign-in despite valid credentials

**Root Cause**: 
- Incorrect async context manager usage in GraphQL resolvers
- Using `async with get_async_session() as session:` when function returns `AsyncGenerator`
- Database session management pattern incompatible with resolver implementation

**Solution**: 
- Changed from `async with get_async_session() as session:` to `async for session in get_async_session():`
- Fixed in both `auth_resolvers.py` and `child_resolvers.py`
- Server auto-reloaded and errors resolved immediately

**Prevention**: 
- Ensure proper async/await patterns with database session generators
- Add TypeScript/Python linting rules for async context manager usage
- Create templates for common GraphQL resolver patterns
- Code review checklist for async database operations

### 4. Email Verification and User Account Management
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-09-05  
**Category**: Authentication flow  

**Problem**: 
- Users appearing to register successfully but unable to sign in
- Confusion between multiple test accounts (`tobe.chukwu.ubah@gmail.com`, `andre_ero@yahoo.ca`)
- Email verification requirements blocking development testing

**Root Cause**: 
- Email verification required but not completed by test users
- Dual storage system (Supabase Auth + PostgreSQL users table) creating sync issues
- Frontend UI showing different email than backend was receiving

**Solution**: 
- Completed email verification for test accounts via confirmation links
- Created automated diagnostic script (`auto_fix_supabase.py`) to check user status
- Applied RLS security policies automatically
- Identified and resolved user account discrepancies

**Prevention**: 
- Clear onboarding flow documentation for development testing
- Implement better user creation/sync flows between Supabase and backend
- Create user account management dashboard for development
- Automated health checks for authentication system components

### 5. Supabase Free Plan Email Rate Limiting
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-09-05  
**Category**: Development constraints  

**Problem**: 
- Supabase free plan limited to 2 emails per hour
- Development testing constrained by email verification requirements
- Unable to create multiple test accounts for feature development

**Root Cause**: 
- Free tier email limits not accounted for in development workflow
- Email confirmation requirement blocking rapid testing iteration
- No alternative authentication testing strategy for development

**Solution**: 
- Use existing verified accounts for continued development
- Email confirmation disabled for development environment
- Created email configuration guide for custom SMTP in production
- Established development testing procedures using known working accounts

**Prevention**: 
- Plan email usage during development phase
- Implement custom SMTP early for unlimited email testing
- Create test account management strategy
- Document development vs production email flow differences

## ACTIVE BOTTLENECKS

### 6. Design System Color Implementation Gap
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTIVE  
**Date Identified**: 2025-09-04  
**Category**: Design system implementation  

**Problem**:
- Updated `Colors.ts` with NestSync design system colors (#0891B2 primary blue, etc.)
- Colors not being applied to UI components - still showing generic Expo colors
- Theme system may not be properly connected to component implementations

**Evidence from Playwright Testing**:
- Login screen still shows generic blue colors instead of NestSync Primary Blue (#0891B2)
- Registration button using default Expo tint colors
- Header and navigation elements not reflecting updated color palette

**Potential Solutions to Investigate**:
1. Check if components are importing from correct color constants
2. Verify theme provider configuration is using updated Colors.ts
3. Review component styling to ensure proper color token usage
4. Check if colors need to be updated in additional theme configuration files

**Next Actions Required**:
- Audit component color usage across the application
- Update theme provider configuration
- Test color changes in development environment

### 7. Registration Form Validation Issues

**Date Identified**: 2025-09-04  
**Category**: Form validation  

**Problem**:
- Registration form accepting invalid email formats
- Password field not enforcing complexity requirements
- Province dropdown working but needs validation integration

**Evidence from Testing**:
- Email field accepts malformed addresses
- No real-time validation feedback for users
- Form submission succeeds with invalid data

**Impact on User Personas**:
- **Sarah (overwhelmed new mom)**: Needs clear, forgiving validation with helpful error messages
- **Mike (efficiency dad)**: Expects quick, accurate feedback to avoid data re-entry

**Next Actions Required**:
- Implement comprehensive form validation
- Add real-time validation feedback
- Ensure Canadian-specific validation (postal codes, phone numbers)

## PREVENTION STRATEGIES

### Cross-Platform Testing
- Always test picker components on both iOS and Android
- Validate form components across platforms before committing
- Use device simulators for comprehensive testing

### Design System Implementation
- Verify color token usage after any design system updates
- Test theme changes in live development environment
- Document theme provider configuration changes

### User Experience Validation
- Test forms with invalid data to ensure proper validation
- Verify error messages are helpful for stressed parents
- Check accessibility compliance for all form elements

### Development Environment Setup
- Create comprehensive development setup checklist
- Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running before testing
- Implement health checks and server status monitoring
- Standardize development ports and document server startup procedures

### Authentication System Reliability
- Always verify email confirmation links are working during testing
- Create automated diagnostic tools for authentication issues
- Test authentication flows after any backend changes
- Monitor Supabase service limits and plan accordingly

### Code Quality and Async Patterns
- Follow proper async/await patterns for database operations
- Use TypeScript/Python linting rules for async context managers
- Create templates for common GraphQL resolver patterns
- Implement code review checklists for backend database operations

### Password Management in Development
**Important Note**: Passwords in Supabase (and any secure authentication system) are stored as cryptographic hashes and cannot be viewed in plain text. This is a security best practice.

**For Development Testing**:
- Keep track of test account passwords you create
- Use password reset functionality when needed
- Consider creating a development user management system
- Document test account credentials securely for the development team
