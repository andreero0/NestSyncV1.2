Child Information → Diaper Inventory → "What's Next?" Screen → Dashboard
                                           ↑
                                    UNNECESSARY FRICTION
```

**Optimized Target Flow:**
```
Child Information → Diaper Inventory → Dashboard (Direct Entry)
                                          ↑
                                   START USING APP
```

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Eliminate Step 4**: Remove `renderWelcomeComplete()` screen entirely
- **Streamline Step 3**: Move notification preferences to Settings or integrate with inventory step
- **Direct Completion**: Call `handleCompleteOnboarding()` immediately after Step 2
- **Preserve Data Integrity**: Maintain all essential data collection and validation
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensure optimization works across web, iOS, and Android

### Technology Stack Integration
- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo with file-based routing
- **State Management**: Zustand for onboarding state tracking
- **Backend Integration**: GraphQL mutations for onboarding completion
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with AuthGuard-based routing logic

## Current State Analysis

### Onboarding Flow Architecture (Current)
Based on analysis of `/NestSync-frontend/app/(auth)/onboarding.tsx`:

```typescript
Step 0: Persona Selection (renderPersonaSelection)
  ↓ handlePersonaSelection() → setCurrentStep(1)
Step 1: Child Information (renderChildInformationSetup)
  ↓ handleNextPhase() → setCurrentStep(2)
Step 2: Inventory Setup (renderInventorySetup)
  ↓ handleNextPhase() → setCurrentStep(3)
Step 3: Notification Preferences (renderNotificationPreferences)
  ↓ handleNextPhase() → setCurrentStep(4)
Step 4: Welcome Complete (renderWelcomeComplete) ← FRICTION POINT
  ↓ handleCompleteOnboarding() → router.replace('/(tabs)')
```

### State Management Analysis
**Current onboarding state tracking** (from `stores/authStore.ts`):

```typescript
// Key state properties
onboardingCompleted: boolean;
onboardingStep: number;

// Completion logic
completeOnboarding: async () => {
  set({ onboardingCompleted: true, onboardingStep: 0 });
  await StorageHelpers.clearOnboardingState();
}
```

### Navigation Architecture Analysis
**AuthGuard routing logic** (from `app/_layout.tsx`):

```typescript
// Critical routing decision point (lines 82-90)
if (user?.onboardingCompleted) {
  // Redirect to main app if onboarding is complete
  router.replace('/(tabs)');
} else {
  // Redirect to onboarding if not complete
  router.replace('/(auth)/onboarding');
}
```

### Backend Integration Points
**GraphQL Schema Analysis**:
- User-level onboarding tracking: `UserProfile.onboardingCompleted: Boolean`
- Child-level wizard steps: `complete_onboarding_step` mutation
- Database schema: `users.onboarding_completed` field with timestamp tracking

## Optimized Architecture Design

### Streamlined Flow Specification

**New Optimized Flow:**
```typescript
Step 0: Persona Selection
  ↓ handlePersonaSelection() → setCurrentStep(1)
Step 1: Child Information (Enhanced)
  ↓ handleNextPhase() → setCurrentStep(2)  
Step 2: Inventory Setup (Enhanced with basic notifications)
  ↓ handleCompleteOnboarding() → Direct to Dashboard
```

### Enhanced Step Architecture

#### Step 1: Child Information (No Changes)
- **Purpose**: Collect essential child profile data
- **Data Collected**: Name, birth date, gender, weight, notes
- **Validation**: Required fields enforced
- **State Management**: Store in `childInfo` state object

#### Step 2: Inventory Setup (Enhanced)
- **Purpose**: Initial diaper inventory + basic notification setup
- **Data Collected**: 
  - Current diaper inventory items
  - **NEW**: Essential notification preferences (low inventory alerts only)
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Quick notification toggle: "Alert me when diapers are running low?"
  - Default smart settings for other notifications
- **Completion Trigger**: Calls `handleCompleteOnboarding()` directly

#### Eliminated Components
- **Step 3**: Notification Preferences → Moved to Settings
- **Step 4**: Welcome Complete Screen → Completely removed

### Direct Completion Architecture

**New handleNextPhase() Logic:**
```typescript
const handleNextPhase = () => {
  if (currentStep === 1) {
    // Validate child information
    if (!childInfo.name.trim()) {
      Alert.alert('Required Field', 'Please enter your child\'s name.');
      return;
    }
    setOnboardingData(prev => ({ ...prev, childInfo }));
    setCurrentStep(2);
  } else if (currentStep === 2) {
    // Complete onboarding directly after inventory setup
    handleCompleteOnboarding();
  }
};
```

**Enhanced handleCompleteOnboarding():**
```typescript
const handleCompleteOnboarding = async () => {
  try {
    // Save all onboarding data
    const finalData = {
      ...onboardingData,
      childInfo,
      inventory: onboardingData.inventory,
      notificationPreferences: getDefaultNotificationSettings()
    };
    
    console.log('Onboarding completed with data:', finalData);
    await complete(); // Updates Zustand state
    // AuthGuard will handle routing to /(tabs) automatically
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error completing onboarding:', error);
    Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to complete onboarding. Please try again.');
  }
};
```

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Implementation Requirements

#### Component Structure Modifications
**File**: `/NestSync-frontend/app/(auth)/onboarding.tsx`

     // Direct completion instead of moving to step 3
     handleCompleteOnboarding();
   }
   ```

2. **Enhance Step 2 UI** (lines 351-490):
   ```typescript
   // Add basic notification toggle to inventory step
   <View style={styles.notificationSection}>
     <Text style={styles.sectionTitle}>Inventory Alerts</Text>
     <View style={styles.switchRow}>
       <Text>Alert when diapers are running low?</Text>
