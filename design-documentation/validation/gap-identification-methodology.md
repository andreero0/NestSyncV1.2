## Gap Identification Overview

This methodology provides a systematic approach for identifying discrepancies between the approved NestSync onboarding design and the current implementation. It includes categorization, prioritization, and tracking frameworks to ensure all gaps are properly addressed.

## Gap Discovery Process

### 1. Systematic Design vs Implementation Comparison

**Documentation-Driven Analysis:**

#### Step 1: Design Specification Inventory
- [ ] **Feature Documentation**: Complete review of all design documents
- [ ] **User Journey Maps**: Detailed flow specifications
- [ ] **Screen State Definitions**: All UI states and transitions
- [ ] **Component Specifications**: Design system implementation requirements
- [ ] **Interaction Patterns**: Animation and behavior specifications

#### Step 2: Implementation Audit
- [ ] **Code Review**: Current implementation analysis
- [ ] **Screen Capture**: All implemented states and flows
- [ ] **Functionality Testing**: Feature completeness validation
- [ ] **Performance Assessment**: Technical implementation quality
- [ ] **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG and platform standards

#### Step 3: Gap Matrix Creation
```
Design Requirement | Implementation Status | Gap Type | Priority | Effort
Phase 2 Consent Flow | Missing Entirely | Feature Gap | P0 | High
Lisa Persona | Missing Entirely | Feature Gap | P0 | Medium
Social Auth Options | Partially Implemented | Feature Gap | P1 | Medium
Animation Polish | Basic Implementation | Quality Gap | P2 | Low
```

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Gap Analysis

**Gap Classification Framework:**

#### Functional Gaps
- **Missing Features**: Designed functionality not implemented
- **Incomplete Features**: Partially implemented functionality
- **Broken Features**: Implemented but non-functional
- **Performance Issues**: Functional but below performance standards

#### Design System Gaps
- **Visual Inconsistencies**: Colors, typography, spacing deviations
- **Component Variations**: Non-standard component implementations
- **Interaction Patterns**: Missing or incorrect animations/transitions
- **Responsive Issues**: Cross-platform or screen size problems

#### Content and Messaging Gaps
- **Missing Content**: Required text or messaging absent
- **Inconsistent Messaging**: Conflicting information across screens
- **Accessibility Content**: Missing alt text, labels, descriptions
- **Canadian Context**: Missing or incorrect Canadian-specific content

#### Psychological and UX Gaps
- **Trust Building**: Missing trust-building elements
- **Stress Reduction**: Elements that increase rather than reduce stress
- **Cognitive Load**: Overwhelming or confusing user experiences
- **Persona Mismatch**: Features that don't serve intended personas

## Current Implementation Gap Assessment

### Critical (P0) Gaps - Must Fix Before Production
