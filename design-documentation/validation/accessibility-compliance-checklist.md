# Reorder Flow Accessibility Compliance Checklist

## Overview

This comprehensive checklist validates the reorder flow feature against NestSync's enhanced WCAG AA+ accessibility standards, with special considerations for sleep-deprived parents managing critical childcare tasks.

## Testing Methodology

### Enhanced Standards Applied
