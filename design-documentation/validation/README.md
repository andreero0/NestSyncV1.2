## Current Implementation Assessment Summary

### Critical Findings (P0 - Must Fix Before Production)

#### 1. Missing Consent & Privacy Flow - **CRITICAL GAP**
- **Design Specification**: Complete 30-90 second consent flow with value proposition, granular controls, affiliate disclosure
- **Current Implementation**: Completely missing - direct jump from splash to authentication
- **Impact**: Legal compliance risk (PIPEDA), trust building failure, user experience gap
- **Priority**: P0 (Must fix before production)

#### 2. Missing Professional Caregiver Persona - **CRITICAL GAP**
- **Design Specification**: Lisa (Professional Caregiver) persona with compliance features and multi-family management
- **Current Implementation**: Completely missing - only 2 of 3 target personas supported
- **Impact**: 10% of target market unsupported, professional market excluded
- **Priority**: P0 (Must implement for complete market coverage)

#### 3. Limited Social Authentication Options - **PARTIAL GAP**
- **Design Specification**: Apple ID, Google, Facebook authentication options
- **Current Implementation**: Biometric and email/password only
- **Impact**: Reduced user convenience, persona preference mismatch
- **Priority**: P1 (High priority for user experience)
