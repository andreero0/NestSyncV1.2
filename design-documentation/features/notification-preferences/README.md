## Feature Overview

### Notification Philosophy

The notification preferences system employs **psychology-based design principles** to create a notification experience that supports rather than overwhelms stressed parents:

1. **Sleep Schedule Respect**: Intelligent quiet hours that adapt to family sleep patterns
2. **Priority-Based Delivery**: Critical notifications break through, routine ones wait for appropriate times
3. **Multi-Caregiver Coordination**: Prevents duplicate notifications across family members
4. **Behavioral Learning**: AI adapts to individual usage patterns and preferences over time

### Psychological Design Rationale

**Stress Reduction**:
- Granular control prevents notification anxiety and overwhelm
- Quiet hours protect precious sleep time for exhausted parents
- Priority system ensures truly urgent matters get attention while filtering noise
- Visual indicators show notification health without creating pressure

**Sleep Protection**:
- Automatic sleep pattern detection through usage behavior analysis
- Emergency override system for truly critical situations (medical alerts)
- Gentle wake-up notifications for scheduled events with gradual volume increase
- Integration with device Do Not Disturb modes for seamless experience

**Caregiver Harmony**:
- Smart coordination prevents multiple caregivers getting duplicate alerts
- Handoff notifications when one caregiver takes over responsibility
- Shared notification history for transparency and communication
- Professional integration for daycare provider coordination

### Intelligent Quiet Hours

**Adaptive Sleep Detection**:
- Machine learning analyzes usage patterns to detect natural sleep windows
- Gradual quiet hour adjustment based on family routine changes
- Weekend vs. weekday sleep pattern recognition
- Holiday and special event schedule adaptations

**Emergency Override System**:
```typescript
interface EmergencyOverride {
  // Medical emergencies always break through
  medicalAlerts: boolean;
  
  // Caregiver handoff notifications
  caregiverEmergency: boolean;
  
  // Critical system failures (app crashes, sync issues)
  systemCritical: boolean;
  
  // User-defined emergency contacts
  emergencyContacts: string[];
}
```

**Gentle Wake Features**:
- Gradual volume increase for scheduled wake notifications
- Haptic-first alerts that escalate to sound if needed
- Smart snooze that considers sleep cycle timing
- Partner consideration (notifications that won't wake spouse)

### Priority-Based Notification System

**Priority Levels**:

1. **Emergency (Override All)**: Medical alerts, safety concerns, caregiver emergencies
2. **High Priority**: Low diaper supply, missed feeding windows, medication reminders
3. **Standard**: Regular log reminders, milestone celebrations, social features
4. **Low Priority**: Weekly summaries, tips and suggestions, promotional content
5. **Background**: Sync confirmations, backup completions, system status updates

**Smart Filtering Algorithm**:
```typescript
interface NotificationFilter {
  // Context-aware filtering
  timeOfDay: 'early_morning' | 'morning' | 'afternoon' | 'evening' | 'night';
  userStressLevel: 'low' | 'moderate' | 'high' | 'overwhelmed';
  recentActivityLevel: number; // Recent app usage intensity
  
  // Caregiver coordination
  activeCaregiver: string; // Who's currently "on duty"
  duplicateFiltering: boolean; // Prevent multiple alerts for same event
  
  // Learning-based optimization
  historicalResponseRate: number; // How often user acts on this notification type
  optimalDeliveryWindow: TimeRange; // Best delivery time for this user
}
```

### Multi-Caregiver Coordination

**Caregiver Status System**:
- **Active Caregiver**: Receives immediate notifications
- **Backup Caregiver**: Receives delayed notifications if no response from primary
- **Sleeping Caregiver**: Notifications held unless emergency override
- **Away Caregiver**: Location-based notification filtering

**Handoff Notifications**:
- Smooth transition notifications when caregivers switch responsibilities
- Context sharing (recent activities, current child status, upcoming needs)
- Acknowledgment system to confirm handoff completion
- Automatic handoff detection based on app usage patterns

**Professional Caregiver Integration**:
```typescript
interface ProfessionalIntegration {
  // Daycare provider coordination
  daycareNotifications: {
    dropoffReminders: boolean;
    dailySummaryDelivery: 'immediate' | 'end_of_day' | 'weekly_digest';
    emergencyContactProtocol: EmergencyContactProtocol;
  };
  
  // Healthcare provider integration
  pediatricianReminders: {
    appointmentNotifications: boolean;
    vaccinationReminders: boolean;
    developmentMilestoneSharing: boolean;
  };
  
  // Privacy controls
  professionalDataSharing: {
    consentLevel: 'basic' | 'standard' | 'comprehensive';
    dataRetentionPeriod: number; // Days
    accessAuditLog: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Canadian Privacy Considerations
