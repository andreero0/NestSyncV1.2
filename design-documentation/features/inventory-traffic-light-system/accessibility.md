# Accessibility Requirements for Stressed Parents

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive accessibility specifications designed specifically for stressed, sleep-deprived Canadian parents managing diaper inventory through the psychology-driven traffic light system. All requirements exceed WCAG AAA standards with special consideration for cognitive load reduction during stressful parenting periods.

## Accessibility Philosophy

### Core Principle: Stressed Parent Support
Design accessibility features that account for the unique challenges faced by sleep-deprived parents, including:
- **Reduced cognitive capacity** during stressful periods
- **Limited fine motor control** when holding a baby or multitasking
- **Visual strain** from fatigue and interrupted sleep
- **Emotional sensitivity** requiring supportive, non-judgmental language

### Enhanced Accessibility Standards
- **WCAG AAA Compliance**: 7:1 contrast ratios for enhanced visibility
- **Psychology-Driven Language**: Screen reader content that reduces stress
- **Canadian Cultural Sensitivity**: Accessibility that respects cultural norms
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Visual, auditory, and haptic feedback integration

## WCAG AAA Compliance
