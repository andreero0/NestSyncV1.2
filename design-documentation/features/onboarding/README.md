## Feature Overview

### Onboarding Philosophy

The NestSync onboarding system is built on **trust-first psychology** for overwhelmed Canadian parents who are already managing significant stress. Every interaction prioritizes building confidence while minimizing cognitive load through:

1. **Trust Building**: Canadian identity, PIPEDA compliance, and transparent data usage
2. **Stress Reduction**: Minimal steps, clear progress, and reassuring messaging
3. **Value Clarity**: Immediate benefit understanding without overwhelming features
4. **Privacy Respect**: Granular consent with clear explanations and user control

### System Architecture

**Four-Phase Onboarding Flow**:
1. **Splash & Brand Introduction** (2-3 seconds) - First impression and trust building
2. **Privacy & Consent** (30-60 seconds) - PIPEDA-compliant transparent data usage
3. **Authentication** (30-45 seconds) - Frictionless account creation with social options
4. **Initial Setup** (60-90 seconds) - Child profile and basic configuration

### Business Objectives

**Primary Goals**:
- **Conversion Rate**: >85% complete full onboarding flow
- **Time to Value**: <3 minutes from install to first successful log
- **Trust Building**: >90% users accept privacy terms without hesitation
- **Retention**: >70% Day-1 retention from onboarded users

**Success Metrics**:
- Drop-off rate <15% across entire flow
- Average completion time <180 seconds
- Privacy consent completion >95%
- Authentication success rate >90%

## User Psychology & Design Rationale

### Target User Mental State

**Sarah (Overwhelmed New Mom)**:
- **Stress Level**: High - managing new baby, sleep deprived
- **Trust Requirements**: Extremely high - protective of baby data
- **Cognitive Capacity**: Limited - needs simple, clear instructions
- **Privacy Awareness**: High - concerned about Canadian data protection

**Mike (Efficiency Dad)**:
- **Approach**: Systematic - wants to understand full system capabilities
- **Speed Expectations**: High - values efficient onboarding
- **Feature Interest**: Medium-High - interested in advanced features
- **Privacy Approach**: Practical - values transparency and control

**Lisa (Professional Caregiver)**:
- **Compliance Focus**: High - needs to ensure professional standards
- **Data Sensitivity**: Very High - handling client family information
- **Setup Requirements**: Detailed - needs comprehensive configuration
- **Privacy Requirements**: Absolute - must meet professional obligations

### Cognitive Load Management Strategy

**Progressive Disclosure Architecture**:
1. **Essential First**: Only critical information in primary flow
2. **Optional Later**: Advanced features accessible post-onboarding
3. **Context-Sensitive**: Information appears when relevant
4. **Escape Hatches**: Always provide way to continue with minimal setup

**Anxiety Reduction Techniques**:
- **Clear Progress**: Always show completion percentage and next steps
- **Time Estimates**: Honest time expectations for each phase
- **Skip Options**: Allow bypassing non-essential steps with clear consequences
- **Reassurance**: Consistent messaging about data security and user control

## Technical Architecture

### State Management

**Onboarding State Structure**:
```typescript
interface OnboardingState {
  // Progress tracking
  currentStep: 'splash' | 'consent' | 'auth' | 'setup' | 'complete';
  completedSteps: string[];
  totalSteps: number;
  
  // User data collection
  privacyConsents: {
    required: {
      childData: boolean;
      accountData: boolean;
    };
    optional: {
      analytics: boolean;
      marketing: boolean;
      recommendations: boolean;
    };
    consentTimestamp: string;
    consentVersion: string;
  };
  
  // Authentication state
  authenticationMethod: 'email' | 'apple' | 'google' | 'facebook' | null;
  userProfile: {
    email?: string;
    displayName?: string;
    isNewUser: boolean;
  };
  
  // Initial setup
  childProfiles: ChildProfile[];
  preferredLanguage: 'en' | 'fr';
  notificationPreferences: NotificationSettings;
  
  // Technical tracking
  sessionId: string;
  startTime: number;
  completionTime?: number;
  abandonmentPoint?: string;
}
```

### Component Integration Architecture

**Screen Flow & Data Passing**:
```
SplashScreen 
  ↓ (auto-advance after loading)
ConsentFlowScreen
  ↓ (consents → onboarding state)
AuthenticationScreen  
  ↓ (user profile → onboarding state)
ChildSetupWizard
  ↓ (child data → onboarding state)
OnboardingComplete
  ↓ (finalize → main app)
```

**Cross-Component Data Flow**:
- **Zustand Store**: Centralized onboarding state management
- **React Context**: Theme and accessibility preferences
- **AsyncStorage**: Persistence for incomplete flows
- **Supabase**: User authentication and profile sync

## Design System Integration

const announceStepChange = (step: string, progress: number) => {
  const message = `Step ${step}, ${progress}% complete. ${getStepDescription(step)}`;
  AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility(message);
};

// Progress updates
const announceProgress = (currentStep: number, totalSteps: number) => {
  const message = `Progress: ${currentStep} of ${totalSteps} steps completed`;
  AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility(message);
};
```

**Focus Management**:
- Automatic focus to first interactive element on each screen
- Logical tab order throughout all flows
- Focus trapping in modal dialogs
- Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements

### Cultural Sensitivity

**Canadian Privacy Awareness**:
- Emphasis on PIPEDA compliance throughout flow
- Canadian flag and identity markers for trust
- Reference to Canadian data storage locations
- Respect for bilingual requirements (English/French support)

**Parenting Stress Awareness**:
- Generous time allowances for each step
- Clear "no judgment" messaging around data collection
- Emphasis on helping rather than tracking
- Reassuring tone throughout all copy

### Platform Accessibility

**iOS Accessibility**:
- VoiceOver optimization with descriptive labels

- Voice Control compatibility
- Switch Control navigation support

**Android Accessibility**:
- TalkBack optimization with proper semantics
- High contrast mode support  
- Large text settings compatibility
- External keyboard navigation

## Performance & Reliability

### Loading Performance

**Asset Optimization**:
- Critical path assets preloaded during splash
- Progressive image loading for non-critical elements
- Vector graphics for scalable elements (maple leaf, icons)
- Lazy loading for subsequent screens

**Network Handling**:
```typescript
// Offline capability during onboarding
const offlineOnboardingSupport = {
  // Store onboarding progress locally
  persistProgress: async (state: OnboardingState) => {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('onboarding_progress', JSON.stringify(state));
  },
  
  // Resume from stored progress
  resumeOnboarding: async (): Promise<OnboardingState | null> => {
    const stored = await AsyncStorage.getItem('onboarding_progress');
    return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : null;
  },
  
  // Sync when online
  syncOnboardingData: async (state: OnboardingState) => {
    // Upload consent data, authentication, profile data
  }
};
```

### Error Recovery

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Social authentication fallback to email/password
- Offline progress storage with online sync
- Step skip options for non-critical data
- Clear error messages with recovery actions

**Abandonment Prevention**:
```typescript
// Track abandonment points
const trackAbandonmentRisk = (currentStep: string, timeOnStep: number) => {
  const riskFactors = {
    timeThreshold: 60000, // 60 seconds
    backButtonPresses: 3,
    helpButtonClicks: 2
  };
  
  if (timeOnStep > riskFactors.timeThreshold) {
    showEncouragementMessage();
  }
};
```
