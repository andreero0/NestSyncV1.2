## Development Workflow Per Feature

### Branch Strategy

```bash
# 1. Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]

# 2. Development with comprehensive tooling
# - Sequential thinking (25+ thoughts) for planning
# - Context7 for documentation research
# - Specialized agents for implementation
# - Playwright MCP for testing

# 3. Merge process (triggered by "maybe" keyword)
git add .
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature/[feature-name]
git commit -m "feat: [comprehensive commit message]"
git push origin main
git branch -d feature/[feature-name]
```

3. **Context7 Research**: Documentation and best practices
4. **Senior Backend Engineer**: Database and API implementation
5. **Senior Frontend Engineer**: UI and state management
6. **QA Test Automation Engineer**: Comprehensive testing
7. **General Purpose Agent**: Integration and coordination

### Complex Problem Resolution Flow

1. **Sequential Thinking**: 25+ thought analysis
2. **Multiple Specialized Agents**: Parallel implementation
3. **Playwright MCP**: Real-time validation
4. **Context7**: Continuous documentation reference
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Based on test results

## Timeline Summary

- **Phase 1** (4 weeks): Foundation - App becomes usable
- **Phase 2** (4 weeks): Intelligence - App becomes valuable  
- **Phase 3** (3 weeks): Collaboration - App becomes social
- **Phase 4** (3 weeks): Premium - App becomes profitable

**Total Timeline**: 14 weeks to full feature completion

## Next Immediate Action

Create branch `feature/inventory-management` and begin Phase 1 implementation to make the app functional with real data instead of mock values.
