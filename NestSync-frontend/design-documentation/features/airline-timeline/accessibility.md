## Animation & Motion Design Guidelines

### Psychology-Driven Animation Principles

#### Stress-Reduction Through Motion
**Calming Animation Characteristics**:
- **Gentle Timing**: No animation faster than 200ms or slower than 800ms
- **Natural Curves**: Physics-based easing that mimics real-world movement
- **Purposeful Motion**: Every animation serves a functional communication purpose
- **Breathing Rhythm**: Pulse animations match relaxed breathing (4-6 second cycles)

**Anxiety-Reduction Patterns**:
- **Smooth Acceleration**: Gradual starts prevent jarring attention shifts
- **Confident Completion**: Clear end states provide closure and certainty
- **Predictable Paths**: Linear and arc-based movements feel natural
- **Gentle Bounce**: Minimal spring effects create friendly personality

#### Motion Hierarchy System
**Animation Priority Levels**:

**Priority 1 - Essential Communication**:
- Current time indicator pulse (always animated)
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Error states and critical feedback
- Focus indicators and accessibility cues

**Priority 2 - Enhanced Experience**:
- Event card hover effects and selection feedback
- Timeline axis brightening during interaction
- Smooth scrolling momentum and snap-to behavior
- Period header transitions during navigation

**Priority 3 - Delight & Polish**:
- Event card stagger-in animations on timeline load
- Subtle parallax effects during scroll
- Success celebration animations for milestones
- Easter egg animations for pattern recognition

### Technical Animation Specifications

#### Performance-Optimized Animation
**Hardware Acceleration Requirements**:
- **Transform-Only Animations**: Use only `transform` and `opacity` properties
- **Layer Promotion**: Strategic `will-change` usage for complex animations
- **60fps Target**: Consistent frame rate across all supported devices
- **Battery Consciousness**: Efficient animations that minimize power consumption

**React Native Animation Integration**:
```typescript
// Example: Physics-based timeline scroll
const scrollAnimation = useSharedValue(0);
const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  transform: [{ translateY: scrollAnimation.value }]
}));

// Scroll momentum with natural deceleration
const handleScroll = (velocity: number) => {
  scrollAnimation.value = withDecay({
    velocity,
    deceleration: 0.998,
    clamp: [minScroll, maxScroll]
  });
};
```

#### Animation State Management
**Loading State Animations**:
- **Timeline Skeleton**: Gentle pulse animation (opacity 0.6-1.0, 2s cycle)
- **Event Card Loading**: Shimmer effect moving left-to-right over 1.5s
- **Progress Indicators**: Rotating spinner or horizontal progress bar
- **Stagger Loading**: Events appear progressively with 100ms delays

**Transition Animations**:
- **Page Entry**: Timeline axis draws upward over 600ms
- **Event Appearance**: Slide from timeline axis with spring animation
- **Focus Transitions**: 300ms ease-out for smooth focus movement
- **State Changes**: 200ms cross-fade for text/color changes

### Reduced Motion Accessibility

#### Motion Sensitivity Support
**Prefers-Reduced-Motion Implementation**:
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Disable non-essential animations */
  .timeline-event-card {
    transition: none;
  }
  
  /* Maintain essential feedback with minimal motion */
  .current-time-indicator {
    animation: none;
    opacity: 1;
  }
  
  /* Preserve usability without animation */
  .focus-indicator {
    transition: opacity 0.1s ease;
  }
}
```

**Alternative Feedback Methods**:
- **Color Changes**: Replace motion-based feedback with color transitions
- **Instant Positioning**: Immediate state changes instead of animated transitions
- **Static Indicators**: Replace pulsing/rotating with static visual cues
- **Text Feedback**: Explicit text descriptions for motion-conveyed information

#### Graceful Motion Degradation
**Essential vs. Optional Motion**:
- **Essential**: Focus indicators, loading states, error feedback
- **Optional**: Decorative hover effects, celebration animations, parallax
- **Adaptive**: Smart detection of motion sensitivity with user override
- **User Control**: Settings panel for individual motion control preferences
