# Airline Timeline User Journey & Interaction Design

## Overview

This document maps the complete user journey through the airline-style timeline interface, detailing interaction patterns, edge cases, and the psychology-driven design decisions that support stressed Canadian parents.

## User Journey Mapping

### Primary User Personas

#### 1. Sarah - New Parent (Primary Persona)
- **Context**: 6-week-old baby, sleep-deprived, anxious about patterns
- **Goals**: Track feeding/diaper patterns, identify trends, gain confidence
- **Pain Points**: Information overload, complex interfaces, decision fatigue
- **Timeline Usage**: Quick glances, pattern recognition, reassurance seeking

#### 2. Marcus - Experienced Parent (Secondary Persona) 
- **Context**: Second child, comparative analysis, efficiency-focused
- **Goals**: Compare patterns between children, optimize schedules, plan ahead
- **Pain Points**: Time constraints, need for quick insights, data comparison
- **Timeline Usage**: Historical analysis, trend identification, planning

#### 3. Dr. Elena - Healthcare Provider (Tertiary Persona)
- **Context**: Pediatrician reviewing parent-reported data during appointments
- **Goals**: Identify concerning patterns, validate parent observations
- **Pain Points**: Time-limited consultations, data interpretation, trust building
- **Timeline Usage**: Quick pattern assessment, anomaly identification

### Core User Journey: Daily Timeline Review

#### Entry Point: Accessing Timeline
**Trigger**: User navigates to timeline from main dashboard

**Entry Experience**:
1. **Loading State** (0-800ms):
   - Skeleton timeline axis appears with gentle fade-in
   - Time period headers load progressively
   - Current time indicator pulses into view
   - Psychology: Immediate sense of structure and progress

2. **Content Materialization** (800-1400ms):
   - Event cards slide in from timeline axis (staggered 100ms delays)
   - Recent events appear first (today/yesterday)
   - Older content loads progressively as user scrolls
   - Psychology: Focus on recent events reduces cognitive load

3. **Ready State** (1400ms+):
   - Full timeline interactive with smooth scroll enabled
   - Current time indicator actively tracking
   - All animations complete, ready for user interaction
   - Psychology: Sense of completion and control

#### Primary Task Flow: Pattern Recognition

**Step 1: Orientation & Current Status**
**User Goal**: Understand "what's happening now"

**Visual State**:
- Timeline opens at current time with "now" indicator prominent
- Today's events visible above fold
- Clear visual hierarchy: recent events larger/brighter
- Current time indicator gently pulsing

**Available Actions**:
- **Scroll**: Natural momentum scrolling with physics-based deceleration
- **Tap Current Time**: Quick return to "now" if user has scrolled away
- **Pull to Refresh**: Update timeline with latest activities

**Psychology Elements**:
- Immediate grounding in present moment reduces anxiety
- Clear "you are here" indication builds confidence
- Recent success events (green checkmarks) provide reassurance

**Step 2: Recent Pattern Analysis**
**User Goal**: "How are we doing today/this week?"

**Interaction Pattern**:
- User scrolls back through today and yesterday
- Event cards highlight on approach (subtle scale effect)
- Pattern recognition aided by consistent color coding
- Time gaps automatically identified and subtly indicated

**Visual Feedback**:
- **Success Pattern**: Multiple green diaper change events create visual rhythm
- **Attention Areas**: Orange/amber events stand out without alarm
- **Progress Indicators**: Size changes and growth milestones celebrated
- **Time Gaps**: Subtle background pattern shows expected vs. actual timing

**Animation Behavior**:
- **Smooth Scroll**: Natural momentum with gentle deceleration
- **Event Highlighting**: Cards briefly brighten when centered on timeline
- **Pattern Visualization**: Subtle connecting lines show event relationships
- **Status Transitions**: Color changes animate smoothly between events

**Step 3: Historical Context & Trends**
**User Goal**: "How does this compare to before?"

**Time Machine Navigation**:
- **Physics-Based Scrolling**: Natural momentum feel like airline departure boards
- **Snap to Periods**: Automatic snapping to day/week boundaries
- **Quick Navigation**: Time period headers act as navigation anchors
- **Progress Awareness**: Scroll progress indicator shows timeline position

**Long-Distance Navigation**:
- **Velocity Scrolling**: Fast scroll activates overview mode
- **Period Headers**: Sticky headers provide constant context
- **Landmark Events**: Size changes and milestones act as visual anchors
- **Quick Jump**: Optional floating navigator for precise time selection

#### Advanced User Flows

**Power User Pattern: Comparative Analysis**

**Interaction Sequence**:
1. **Anchor Current Pattern**: User memorizes recent pattern
2. **Navigate to Comparison Period**: Scroll to previous week/month
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Visual comparison of event density and timing
4. **Insight Formation**: User identifies trends and changes
5. **Return to Present**: Quick navigation back to current time

**Supported Interactions**:
- **Bookmark Positions**: Long press to mark interesting time periods
- **Pattern Highlighting**: Tap event type to highlight similar events
- **Density Visualization**: Visual rhythm shows activity patterns

- **Event Integrity**: Maintain chronological accuracy across zones

#### 5. Real-Time Updates
**Scenario**: Timeline data updates while user is viewing

**Live Update Strategy**:
- **Gentle Integration**: New events slide in without disrupting scroll
- **Current Focus**: Updates only above current viewing position
- **Visual Indicators**: Subtle animation for new event arrival
- **Persistence**: Maintain scroll position during updates

## Interaction Design Specifications

### Time Machine Scrolling Mechanics

- User stops active scrolling for 300ms
- Manual tap on timeline area or event

**Snap Target Priority**:
1. **Significant Events**: Size changes, milestones, anomalies
2. **Period Boundaries**: Day starts, week beginnings
3. **Current Time**: Always available as snap target
4. **Even Time Markers**: Hour boundaries for clean alignment

**Snap Animation**:
- **Duration**: 400ms for near targets, 600ms for distant
- **Easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` for purposeful movement
- **Visual Feedback**: Target event briefly highlights during animation
- **Haptic Response**: Gentle vibration on snap completion (iOS/Android)

### Touch Interaction Patterns
