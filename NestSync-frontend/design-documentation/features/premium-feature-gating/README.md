# Premium Feature Gating Design System

## Overview

This comprehensive design system enables stress-reducing, psychology-driven monetization of NestSync's non-diaper product inventory management (baby bags, powder, wipes, creams, etc.) through premium tier subscription gating.

**Strategic Philosophy**: Transform premium features from barriers into helpful family tools that users want to unlock, rather than obstacles they must overcome.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Stress-Reduction First**
- Premium gating should reduce cognitive load, not add to parental stress
- Visual treatments should feel calming and supportive
- Messaging focuses on empowerment rather than restriction

**Canadian Cultural Sensitivity**
- Transparent pricing without hidden fees
- Explicit PIPEDA compliance messaging
- Trust-building through Canadian data residency assurance
- Respectful, non-aggressive upgrade prompts

**Family Empowerment Messaging**
- "Unlock more tools to help your family" vs "Upgrade to continue"
- "Complete baby care organization" vs "Access premium features"
- "Simplify your routine" vs "Get more functionality"

**Progressive Value Discovery**
- Users discover premium value naturally through core feature usage
- Gentle introduction to premium benefits without interrupting workflow
- Clear value propositions before any payment requests

## Visual Hierarchy System

### Premium Indicator Design Language

**Subtle Premium Badges**
- Small, non-intrusive indicators using NestSync's primary blue (#0891B2)
- 18x18px crown or star icon with 20% opacity background
- Positioned top-right of premium content cards
- Never dominant or attention-grabbing

**BlurView Treatment Specifications**
- `blurType: 'light'` for iOS, `'systemMaterial'` as fallback
- `blurAmount: 25` for gentle content preview
- `reducedTransparencyFallbackColor: '#F0F8FF80'` for accessibility
- Subtle border radius matching NestSync design system (12px)

**Color Psychology Implementation**
- Primary: #0891B2 (existing NestSync blue - trust, calm)
- Premium Accent: #10B981 (calming green - growth, positive action)
- Gentle Warning: #F59E0B (warm amber - gentle attention)
- Background Tints: 5% opacity overlays for premium content areas

### Typography Hierarchy for Premium Content

**Premium Feature Labels**
- Font: `Inter-Medium, 14px, #0891B2`
- Letter spacing: 0.2px
- All caps with gentle styling: `COMING SOON FOR PREMIUM`

**Value Proposition Headlines**
- Font: `Inter-SemiBold, 18px, #1F2937`
- Line height: 1.4
- Maximum 2 lines for readability

**Support Copy**
- Font: `Inter-Regular, 16px, #6B7280`
- Line height: 1.5
- Conversational, supportive tone

## Psychology-Driven UX Principles

### Stress-Reduction Through Design

**Cognitive Load Management**
- Maximum 3 pieces of information in premium prompts
- Clear visual hierarchy guides attention naturally
- Generous whitespace prevents overwhelming feeling

**Trust Building Elements**
- Canadian flag icon (12x8px) with "Data stored in Canada" copy
- "Cancel anytime" messaging prominently displayed
- Transparent pricing with no hidden fees
- PIPEDA compliance badge in settings

**Gentle Discovery Patterns**
- Premium content revealed through natural usage patterns
- No pop-ups or interruptions during core diaper tracking
- Contextual premium suggestions during inventory browsing

### Parental Empathy Integration

**Understanding User Context**
- Assume users are tired, stressed, multitasking
- Design for one-handed operation and quick comprehension
- Provide clear value propositions without marketing speak

**Supportive Messaging Tone**
- "We're here to help make parenting easier"
- "Track everything your family needs in one place"
- "Designed for busy Canadian parents like you"

## Technical Architecture

### BlurView Implementation Stack

}

export function PremiumGate({ children, onUpgradePress, feature }: PremiumGateProps) {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <BlurView
        blurType="light"
        blurAmount={25}
        reducedTransparencyFallbackColor="#F0F8FF80"
        style={styles.blurOverlay}
      >
        <PremiumPrompt 
          onUpgradePress={onUpgradePress}
          feature={feature}
        />
      </BlurView>
    </View>
  );
}
```
