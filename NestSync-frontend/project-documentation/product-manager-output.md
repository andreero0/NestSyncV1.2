**Date**: January 2025  
**Document Type**: Strategic Product Realignment  
**Status**: Critical - Scope Drift Correction Required

---

## Executive Summary

### Elevator Pitch
NestSync helps stressed Canadian parents never run out of diapers by predicting usage patterns and managing diaper inventory with psychology-driven, supportive UX.

### Problem Statement
Canadian parents experience significant anxiety around diaper supply management, with research showing that "diaper need" affects 50% of families and is a greater contributor to postpartum depression than food or housing insecurity. Currently, no dedicated diaper planning solutions exist in the Canadian market, leaving parents to rely on general baby tracking apps or complex inventory management systems that add stress rather than reduce it.

### Target Audience
**Primary**: Canadian parents with children ages 0-3 years
- **Demographics**: 25-40 years old, household income $40K-120K CAD
- **Psychographics**: Stressed, sleep-deprived, seeking simplicity and reassurance
- **Pain Points**: Fear of running out of diapers, budget planning anxiety, size transition confusion

### Critical Issue: Scope Drift Identified
NestSync has evolved from its core diaper planning mission into a comprehensive baby product inventory management system, causing:
- **Feature Bloat**: 7 product categories vs. diaper focus
- **User Confusion**: Mixed messaging about core value proposition
- **Development Complexity**: Over-engineered solutions for MVP needs
- **Market Position Unclear**: Competing with general inventory apps instead of solving specific diaper anxiety

### Unique Selling Proposition
The only diaper-specific planning app for Canadian parents that combines usage prediction, inventory management, and psychology-driven stress-reduction UX with PIPEDA-compliant data protection.

### Success Metrics
- **Primary KPI**: Days without diaper stockouts (target: 95% of users)
- **User Engagement**: Daily active usage during peak anxiety periods
- **Psychological Impact**: User-reported stress reduction scores
- **Business Metrics**: User acquisition cost vs. lifetime value in Canadian market
