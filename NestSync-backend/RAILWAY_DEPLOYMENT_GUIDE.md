# Or deploy with specific service name
railway deploy --service nestsync-backend
```

**Expected Deployment Output:**
```
üöù Building and deploying...
‚úÖ Build completed successfully
‚úÖ Deployment live at: https://nestsync-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

### **Step 5: Verify Deployment**
```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
```

## üîí **SECURITY & COMPLIANCE CONFIGURATION**

### **Canadian Data Residency (PIPEDA Compliance)**
```bash
# Ensure Canadian region settings
railway variables set DATA_REGION="canada-central"
railway variables set TZ="America/Toronto" 
railway variables set PIPEDA_COMPLIANCE="true"
railway variables set DATA_RETENTION_MONTHS="24"
```

### **Security Headers & CORS**
```bash
# Production CORS settings
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS="https://your-frontend-domain.com"

# Rate limiting
railway variables set RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE="100"
railway variables set RATE_LIMIT_BURST="200"
```

## üìä **MONITORING & HEALTH CHECKS**

### **Health Check Endpoints** (Already configured):
- **Primary**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`
- **Simple**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health/simple`
- **API Docs**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/docs`
- **GraphQL**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/graphql`

### **Railway Monitoring Setup**:
1. **Dashboard**: Monitor CPU, Memory, Network in Railway dashboard
2. **Alerts**: Configure alerts for downtime/errors
3. **Logs**: Access via `railway logs` or Railway dashboard

---

## üåê **CUSTOM DOMAIN CONFIGURATION**

### **Add Custom Domain**:
```bash
# Add your domain
railway domain add your-api-domain.com

# Configure DNS (Add CNAME record):
# CNAME: api -> your-app.up.railway.app
```

### **SSL Configuration**:
- Railway automatically provides SSL certificates
- HTTPS enforced by default
- Certificate renewal handled automatically

---

## üöÄ **SCALING & PERFORMANCE**

## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**:

#### **1. Build Failures**
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --filter build

# Verify Dockerfile
docker build -t nestsync-test .
docker run -p 8000:8000 nestsync-test
```

#### **2. Environment Variable Issues**
```bash
# List all variables
railway variables

# Check specific variable
railway variables get SUPABASE_URL
```

#### **3. Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Test database connectivity
railway run python -c "from app.config.database import test_connection; test_connection()"
```

#### **4. Health Check Failures**
```bash
# Test health endpoint locally
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Check production health
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
```
